Welcome to the Trac Admin Toolkit. This README.TXT file describes how to
install  the toolkit.

Refer to the README.TXT file for instructions on how to use the
toolkit.

**** Apache Configuration:

The toolkit includes two Apache configuration files:

    - trac.conf
    - subversion.conf

Change the setting "AuthName" in both files; they should both share
the same value.

Copy these files as root into /etc/httpd/conf.d (or the appropriate
directory on your server). Rename if they conflict with any existing
files.

Restart Apache using one of the following (you may have to modify the
path to match your system):

    /sbin/apachectl graceful
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd graceful

**** Toolkit Configuration

Modify the admin_scripts/config.py script to suit your system and your
needs.

Note that the default directory for storing Trac environments and
Subversion repositories is /srv. This is configurable in config.py.

**** Script Installation:

As root, manually copy the contents of the admin-scripts directory
(including the hooks directory) to /root/bin. Make sure that all of the
trac-admin-* scripts are executable:

    mkdir /root/bin
    cp -v -R admin_scripts/* /root/bin
    chmod o+x /root/bin/trac-admin-*

Note: an installation script will be developed in the future.

**** Initialise Server

Use the trac-admin-init script to initialise the server. This creates the
following directories (assuming the configured default root is /srv):

    /srv
    /srv/svn
    /srv/trac
