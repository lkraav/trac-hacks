Welcome to the Trac Admin Toolkit. This README.TXT file describes how to
use the toolkit.

Refer to the INSTALL.TXT file for instructions on how to install the
toolkit.

**** Create New Project - trac-admin-mkproject

The Admin Toolkit makes it easy to create a new project. Simply run
the script and answer a few questions, including a short project name and
a one line description.

The script creates the following, assuming you enter "project" as the
short project name:

    Postgresql database called "support"
    Trac environment in /srv/trac/support
    Subversion repository "support" in /srv/svn/support
    
The script will also ask if it should install the Subversion hooks for
this project:

    pre-commit      ensures the developer includes a Trac ticket in the
                    commit comment
    post-commit     appends the changeset to the Trac ticket as a
                    comment 

The will ask if the default Trac milestones and versions should be
deleted.

**** Delete Existing Project - trac-admin-rmproject

Deleting an existing project is also easy - simply run the
trac-admin-rmproject script. The script deletes:

    the Subversion repository
    the Trac environment
    the Postgresql database

**** Add New User / Change User Password -  - trac-admin-useradd

Anonymous users have read-only access for new projects. To gain write
access, users must be added to the .htpasswd file. This is achieved using
the trac-admin-useradd script. It lets you add a user to multiple
projects.

The script can also be used to change a user's password.

**** Delete User  - trac-admin-userdel

The trac-admin-userdel script deletes a user from the .htpasswd file.
This removes all write privileges for that user for the given Trac
environments and Subversion repositories.

**** Promote User - trac-admin-promote

The trac-admin-promote script gives a user admin privileges on one or
more Trac environments.

**** Demote User - trac-admin-demote

The trac-admin-demote script removes admin privileges for a user on one
or more Trac environments.
