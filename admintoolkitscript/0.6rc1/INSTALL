Welcome to the Trac Admin Toolkit. This README.TXT file describes how to
install  the toolkit.

Refer to the README.TXT file for instructions on how to use the
toolkit.

**** Apache Configuration:

The toolkit includes two Apache configuration files and a project template:

    - trac.conf
    - subversion.conf
    - project.template

Change the setting "AuthName" in the project.template; they should all be
the same value.

**** Toolkit Configuration

Modify the admin_scripts/config.py script to suit your system and your
needs.

Note that the default directory for storing Trac environments and
Subversion repositories is /srv. This is configurable in config.py.

**** Script Installation:

As root the admintoolkit/ directory to a convienent location, such as 
/usr/local or /root. Make sure that all of the admin_scripts trac-admin-*
and svn-admin-* scripts are executable.  Then add the admin_scripts directory
to your path.

    mv admintoolkit /usr/local
    chmod +x /usr/local/admin_scripts/*-admin-*
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/admin_scripts

Note: an installation script will be developed in the future.

**** Initialise Server

Use the trac-admin-init script to initialise the server. This creates the
following directories (assuming the configured default root is /srv) and
initialized the postgresql database if one does not already exist.

    /srv
    /srv/svn
    /srv/trac
    /srv/conf
    /srv/pgsql
