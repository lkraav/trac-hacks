Agilo Ticket Report Plugin

Install

1. Download latest pyExcelerator lib and install it.
     --- pyExcelerator is open source python excel library
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pyexcelerator/

2. Configure

TicketReport\AgiloTicketReport\ticketreport.py
line 35

if you use single project
# just left PROJECT_NAME_PREFIX empty
  PROJECT_NAME_PREFIX = ""
else # use multiple projects
 for example:
# http://[ip]:[port]/projects/[PROJECT_NAME]
  PROJECT_NAME_PREFIX = "projects"

It should find a way work around this ugly configuration, I'll try to fix it later. :)


3. working time time set up (optional)
TicketReport\AgiloTicketReport\gethours.py
line 12
start time and end time of working day, and holiday configuration
