"""Filters can remove subscriptions after they are collected.

This is commonly done based on access restrictions for Trac realm and
resource ID, that the event is referring to (alias 'event target').
In some contexts like AccountManagerPlugin account change notifications
(realm 'acct_mgr') an `IAnnouncementSubscriptionFilter` implementation is
essential for meaningful operation
(see announcer.opt.acct_mgr.announce.AccountManagerAnnouncement).

Only subscriptions, that pass all filters, can trigger a distributor to emit a
notification about an event for shipment via one of its associated transports.
