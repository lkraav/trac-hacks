ASCIIMath: Convert Simple ASCII to MathML
=========================================

Implements ASCIIMathML as a macro for Trac

Description
-----------
This macro allows equations to be written in a simple text format using
a subset of the ASCIIMathML syntax.  When the page is requested, the 
ASCII text is transformed into MathML, which can be rendered in any
capable browser (Firefox for sure, IE with MathPlayer plugin, maybe
Opera).  

See [https://github.com/favalex/python-asciimathml] for more info.
        
Usage
-----
This macro is relatively simple to use.  For example, to create a MathML 
representation of the Pythagorean theorem, one would enter 

{{{!#ASCIIMath
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
}}}

and the resulting wiki page's source should now contain:

<math><mstyle><msup><mi>a</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>+</mo><msup><mi>b</mi>
<mn>2</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><msup><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mstyle></math>

For more information about formatting the ASCII code describing the equation,
see http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html.  Some items might
not display exactly as shown.
