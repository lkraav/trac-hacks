Essentially, AutoTrac is a plugin for Trac which allows Trac to behave
as a server for software equiped with the BugReporter client library,
which is designed to automatically send out errors over HTTP when the
software crashes.  

Both AutoTrac, and the BugReporter client code are included here.  

More documentation will be added soon.
