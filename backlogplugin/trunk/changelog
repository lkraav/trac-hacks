backlog-0.2 (not yet released) - trunk
 resolved issues:
 * #10330: Out of range timestamp errors were being generated due to change
   in storage of timestamps to microsecond format in Trac 0.12.
 * #8653: The `env` object was not being assigned as a member variable of
   the BacklogList class, but was later being called.
 * #10326: The `unique` attribute is no longer a Column attribute
   (since [t 9406]), and was never utilized within the trac.db.api.Column
   class anyway.
 * #10326: The `req` object was being overwritten in the template space.
 * #10326: Fixed 'cannot operate on closed cursor' error.
