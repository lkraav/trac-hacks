**********************************************
** BatchModifyPlugin 0.3 (January 26, 2010) **
**********************************************

This release fixes the plugin so that it actually does something on 0.11 again. In addition the
comment field is now a textarea and the batch modify fieldset is collapsible. By default it is collapsed.

Thanks to Ikraav, otaku42, and thomassvs for patches.
