What is CondFieldsGenshi for?
-----------------------------

With the help of this Trac plugin you can hide or show fields when
creating or viewing a ticket, depending on the ticket type. Only the
presentation changes, not the contents of the ticket.

CondFieldsGenshi is derived from the "Dynamic fields by ticket type" Plugin
[1], but it is completely based on Genshi now instead of using
Javascript. Moreover, you can select whether selected fields are hidden
or shown by default.

This plugin is "standalone"; the patch
"blackmagic-conditionalfields.patch" in [1] did not match with newer
releases of Trac 0.11.


Example
-------

First, configure trac.ini as in this example:

  [components]
  condfieldsgenshi.* = enabled

  ...

  [condfieldsgenshi]
  tweaks = field1, field2, field3
  default = disabled
  field1.type_cond = defect
  field2.type_cond = task
  field3.type_cond = !enhancement, task


Effect:

Now field1 will be shown only if the ticket type is "defect", field2
only if the ticket type is "task", and field3 only if the ticket type is
neither "task" nor "enhancement".

The entry "default = disabled" means that the field listed under "tweaks"
are NOT shown by default.
The default value is "default = enabled".

To disable/enable a field independent of the ticket type, simply write a line
like

  field1.type_cond =

When you change the ticket type, you must "preview" or submit" before you can
see the effect of of CondFieldsGenshi.


Bug fix done for "type" field
-----------------------------

When the ticket type is given as an URL parameter only:

.../newticket?type=task

and the ticket type field is disabled, this plugin works nevertheless
(in contrast to the Dynamic fields by ticket type plugin, cf. [1]).

The type field label is extended by "(Fixed)" in this case now.


Extensions
----------

It should be easy to implement showing or hiding fields based on further
parameters as wanted in

Comparison with DynamicFieldsPlugin
-----------------------------------

The DynamicFieldsPlugin [2] has similar and more powerful
features than CondFieldsGenshi but it can change the field contents: When the
user changes the type and some fields vanish, the values in these fields
are lost and will not appear again even if the former type is restored.
A rule "(fieldname).clear_on_hide = false" avoids this but then the
field is shown anyway.

There are other problems reported about the DynamicFieldsPlugin:

- Very slow performance for a larger number of custom fields [3] are
  obviously caused by javascript in the DynamicFieldsPlugin.
  CondFieldsGenshi is based on Genshi and thus does filtering on the server
  side with much higher performance.

- Problems when sorting the fields as reported in [4] are also due to
  some bug in the javascript and should not happen for CondFieldsGenshi.
