Preparation
===========

The plugin relies on the ability to serve up css using a Genshi
TextTemplate.  This requires the trac-0.11dev.patch be applied to
Trac.  I am hoping there will be a way to avoid this very soon.

Installation
============

1. Create the egg file and copy it to your plugins directory.

$ python setup.py bdist_egg
$ cp dist/CustomRoadmap-0.3-py2.3.egg $PATH_TO_TRAC/plugins/


2. Edit your trac.ini to enable the new roadmap stats provider.

[roadmap]
stats_provider = CustomRoadmapTicketGroupStatsProvider

[milestone]
stats_provider = CustomRoadmapTicketGroupStatsProvider


3. Define your new roadmap groups in trac.ini.

[roadmap-groups]
groups = closed,open,new

closed.status = closed
closed.color = #bae0ba
closed.counts = true

open.status = assigned,reopened
open.color = #ffff00

new.status = new
new.color = #ffffff
