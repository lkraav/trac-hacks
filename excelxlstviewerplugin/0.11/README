This hack allows uploaded Excel files on the Wiki or in tickets to be viewed in
the web browser as a simple HTML table. It allows everybody to easily view the
files without Downlading and saving the Excel files and without even requiring
Microsoft Excel. It is derived from the ExcelViewerPlugin hack but depends upon
the openpyxl library (easy_install xlrd). After installing add

   application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet:xlsx,application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet.macroEnabled.12:xlsm

to the mime_map property in trac.ini to tell Trac which types of file work with the plugin. 

Upload an Excel document from an up-to-date version of Microsoft Excel as an
attachment. As long as it is in the new xlst format the plugin will work. For
older files use ExcelViewerPlugin. If it doesn't work confirm xlrd is installed
correctly by running python and entering "import xlrd". You should see no error.
Also ensure that mime_map is set properly as documented above.
