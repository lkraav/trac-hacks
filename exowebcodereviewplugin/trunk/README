Code Review in Trac
===================

-----------
Description
-----------

A Trac plugin to aiding code review in development process.

------------
Installation
------------

  * Install CodeReview egg, just like you would any other Trac plugin. Drop the 
    egg into your plugins or site-packages folder and then try to access Trac 
    in your browser. You will get an error message saying that the database 
    needs to be upgraded and telling you to use the trac-admin command to do 
    it. (I think it's something like 'trac-admin PathToYourProject upgrade'). 
    Perform the upgrade.
  * Put the files under site_templates into your trac sites's templates folder
  * Patch your Trac code: find installed Trac code, which is usually 
    /usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages/trac, and then apply corresponding patches 
    in CodeReview plugin
    patches/0.11.1/trac/versioncontrol/templates/changeset.html.diff, it just add
    a code review link into the changeset page
  * Adjust email notification settings on codereview manager page 
    (http://your_trac_site/CodeReviewManager) as you like.  Please make sure 
    you have CODE_REVIEW_ADMIN permission.
  * Assign permissions to users for 'CODE_REVIEW_VIEW' and 'CODE_REVIEW_ADMIN'. 
    The CODE_REVIEW_ADMIN permission gives users writable access to the page of 
    CODEREVIEW Manager.
