CodeReview Plugin Tutorial
==========================


Why code review
===============

Code review is a basic mechanism for validating the design and
implementation.  It also helps us maintain a level of consistency
in design and implementation practices across the many developers,
especially within distributed work environment.

Code review has two purposes. Their first purpose is to make sure that
the code that is being produced has sufficient quality to be released. In
other words, it's the acid test for whether the code should be promoted to
the next step in the process. Code reviews are very effective at finding
errors of all types, including those caused by poor structure, those that
don't match business process, and also those simple omissions. That's
why they are an effective litmus test for the quality of the code.
The second purpose is as a teaching tool to help developers learn when
and how to apply techniques to improve code quality, consistency, and
maintainability. Through thoughtfully evaluating code on a recurring
basis, developers have the opportunity to learn different and potentially
better ways of coding.


Why CodeReview Plugin
=====================

CodeReview plugin is a Trac plugin to facilitate code review with more
automation and fun.  CodeReview plugin follows the philosophy of Trac,
imposing as little as possible on a team's established development process
and policies.  A code review is just comments of WiKi format on a commit.
Thanks the power of Trac WiKi, which is really quick and productive.
Developers can add as many comments on committed code as possible if
they like.  CodeReview also provides email notification so that they
could get valuable feedback from others once code review is completed.

The following sections will show you how to use CodeReview efficiently.
Let's assume that Trac has been installed to http://localhost/trac,
and also CodeReview has been installed and configured.  If not, please
refer to README under top directory of CodeReview plugin.

Getting Started
===============

It's easy and simple to create a new code review.  Open the web page
(http://localhost/trac/CodeReview) using your favourate browser, and you
will see that all the commits are listed in the section, "Awaiting code
review", in which each line in this section contains the information
of the commit, click-able id, date, click-able "New", comment, path.
To create a new code review, just click "New" :-)  Each code review
is just WiKi, and you can edit it as you like.  We usually choose the
following format
::

  == somebody 1 ==
  bla bla bla bla
  
  == somebody 2 ==
  bla bla bla bla

CodeReviewPlugin also provides "Preview" and "Attach File", for better
code review experience.

Once you create a code review and edit something, you can set it to
the status of "Undergoing review", "Completely reviewed" or "No need
to review" depending on the process rule of your team.  Once the code
review is set to either of the latter two kinds status, the commit line in
CodeReview main page will be moved to "CompletelyReviewed" page; or the
commit will move up to the section of "Undergoing review" in CodeReview
main page, so that others can continue to add or edit this code review.

To facilitate reviewing small trivial commits and bad commits, CodeReview
provides two quick buttons on the bottom of CodeReview main page,
"No need to review" and "Set to critical".  You can select multiple
commits and set them to either of these two states.


Email Notification
==================

Automated email notification is definitely necessary, so that developers
needn't stop work on hand to search and check code reviews.  Usage is
transparent, once notification is properly configured.  Email notification
depends on notification section of trac.ini in your Trac instance.
Once configured properly, developers will get the feedback from others
after code review is completed.  Administrator can also set teamlist
field in http://localhost/trac/CodeReviewManager, so that all the team
members could be notified.
