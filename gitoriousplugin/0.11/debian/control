Description: Use Gitorious as the source code hosting provider
 This plugin is useful if the source code is hosted on Gitorious, instead of
 locally in Trac.
 .
 The plugin changes the links to point to Gitorious instead of the built-in
 browser. It does not require the GitPlugin, but uses it if it's available. In
 this case, you should setup a local clone of your Gitorious repository, and
 keep it updated.
