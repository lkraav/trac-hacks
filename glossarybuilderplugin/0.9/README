This trac plug-in provides for a way to build a glossary with
automatic index creation/ update. Whenever a term is added to the
glossary (by default, any page under 'Glossary/'), a link
to it is also added to the index (by default, Glossary/Index).

Page deletions are also tracked and handled, with links being
removed from the index.

Each of the various items defining the glossary (root name,
index page name, etc) are customisable through the trac
config file in the [glossary] section.

Examples:

1. A new site with no glossary entries. As entries are created
under 'Glossary/' (for example, 'Glossary/Wiki'), a link
is added to the Glossary/Index page. A link to the index
itself is also added to the Glossary/Wiki page.

2. An existing site with glossary entries under 'Terms/'.
Edit the trac conf file to define:

prefix = Terms

Edit any of the Terms/* pages. 'Terms/Index' will be
created, but empty. Click the 'rebuild' link on the
Index page and it will be populated with all pages under
'Terms/'


Configuration, defaults shown:

# The prefix used as the top-level path element for glossary pages.
prefix = Glossary

# The name of the index page itself, without prefix
index = Index

# The name used when saving automatic pages
# If set to 'author', the name of the editing user will be used.
author = automatic

# The URL used to rebuild the glossary index.
rebuild_url = rebuild_glossary_index

# Where automatic links to the index are placed on each glossary page.
# May be 'top', 'bottom', or 'None', in any mix of case.
index_link_placement = None
