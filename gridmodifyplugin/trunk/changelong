gridmodifyplugin - 0.1.6 (not yet released)
 resolved issues
 * #10519: Description of field changes was not being included in the
   notification. 
 * #10418: Superfluous "updated by gridmod plugin" comment no longer added
   when editing the grid.
 * #10506: Cast ticket ID to an int before passing to the `Ticket` constructor
   to avoid an exception with AgiloTrac.
 * #9659: Navigate the DOM more precisely when retrieving the ticket ID to
   avoid problems on modified templates or alternate versions of Trac.
 * Replaced custom option parsing code with a call to `ListOption` in the Trac
   API, which eliminates sensitivity to whitespace in the option value.
