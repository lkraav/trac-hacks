             !    Ideally it would be nice to be able to use Genshi xi:include
             !    but there's currently no way to specify /no/ parsing on the
             !    included file, as in:
             !
             !      <xi:include href="$path" parse="" />
             !
             !    (using parse="text" won't work either, as the output will be
             !     HTML escaped)
             !-->
