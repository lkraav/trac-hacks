Changes in version 1.1:
    - Fix: jQuery selectors are now cached less aggressively, so the plugin
      works with fields managed by TracTicketChainedFieldsPlugin. (#12899)

    - Fix: Option-select fields in which one of the valid values is blank
      are now handled correctly.

    - Fix: Initial values of radio buttons are now selected correctly.

    - The values in the sets of options for a single option-select field no
      longer need to be disjunct. If more than one set of options is
      available, the union of those sets is taken.

    - A utility script has been provided to create KISplugin configurations
      by importing TracTicketChainedFieldsPlugin configurations.

    - An array named 'ui' is exported to the browser window. It contains
      objects representing the fields controlled by KISplugin, allowing the
      user to manipulate or inspect those fields from the browser console.
