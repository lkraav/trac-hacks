== LdapSessionSettingsPatch ==

This patch adds functionality to retrieve email and name from 
an Active Directory server for a logged in user if their either 
their 'Name' and/or 'Email' session settings are blank. Looks for 
[session] trac.ini flags to enable/disable/configure each. 


==== DEPENDENCIES ====
* pywin32 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)
* active_directory (http://tgolden.sc.sabren.com/python/active_directory.html)
* Trac 0.11dev-r5883 or newer (might work with lower revs, but this is what I tested on); 
 
NOTE: this patch adds module-level imports in session.py for the
two required modules, pywin32 and active_directory. These imports
are wrapped inside (1) a platform sanity-check (platform.system() == 'Windows') 
and (2) each import is within its own try/except. If any of the checks 
fail, then none of the new code will ever be reached. 


==== SETUP ====
1) install the required modules: pywin32 and active_directory 
2) Apply the file patch session_patch.diff to your existing 
	/trac/web/session.py (or just copy (and rename) the provided 
	session_full.py over your existing /trac/web/session.py -- BACKUP
	YOUR ORIGINAL FIRST!!) 
	
3) Modify your trac.ini file [session] section (see the included trac.ini.sample):
[session]
## this setting indicates that if the user hasn't filled 
##   in a name on their 'Preferences' page, go try and 
##   grab it from the LDAP/AD server (the 'displayName' user property)
## defaults:
##   get_name_from_ldap_if_empty = false
##   get_name_from_ldap_userattribute = displayName
get_name_from_ldap_if_empty = true
get_name_from_ldap_userattribute = displayName

## this setting indicates that if the user hasn't filled 
##   in an email on their 'Preferences' page, go try and 
##   grab it from the LDAP/AD server (the 'mail' user property)
## defaults:
##   get_email_from_ldap_if_empty = false
##   get_email_from_ldap_userattribute = mail
get_email_from_ldap_if_empty = true
get_email_from_ldap_userattribute = mail

4) restart Apache


==== TROUBLESHOOTING ====
Q) Nothing is happening!  WTF?!?!
A) Verify that your Active Directory server isn't setup to ALWAYS require 
	authentication, even for read-only operations (like a search/query).
	If it IS configured to always require authentication, then you must 
	change your Apache service to run as an authenticated user, not as
	SYSTEM (which is the default).
	
Q) STILL nothing is happening!!!
A) Check the user attribute that you specified against the available user 
	attributes on your Active Directory setup, as these could certainly be
	changed.  The best way to do this is via an interactive python session:
	>>> import active_directory
	>>> u = ad.find_user('someuser')
	>>> u.foobar
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
	  File "build\bdist.win32\egg\active_directory.py", line 421, in __getattr__
	AttributeError
