Trac Metapost Plugin v0.0.1 Release Notes
=========================================
May 22, 2010

First release of Trac Metapost Plugin.


More Information
----------------

The graphviz plugin macro home page can be found at:
https://trac-hacks.swapoff.org/wiki/MetapostPlugin

The plugin is almost not tested. Since I was interested solving
my particular problem with lack of good UML diagrams in my TRAC, I tested
only my configuration. Extended testing for different other versions,
platforms and configurations would be appreciated.

Bugs and enhancement requests can be submitted at:
