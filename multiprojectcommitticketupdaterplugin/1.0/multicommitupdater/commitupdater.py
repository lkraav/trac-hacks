    Extending the functionality of CommitTicketUpdater, this component hooks
    into changeset notifications and searches commit messages for text in the
    form of:
    {{{
    command my-project:#1
    command my-project:#1, #2
    command my-project:#1 & #2
    command my-project:#1 and #2
    }}}

    You can have more than one command in a message. The following commands
    are supported. There is more than one spelling for each command, to make
    this as user-friendly as possible.

      close, closed, closes, fix, fixed, fixes::
        The specified tickets are closed, and the commit message is added to
        them as a comment.

      references, refs, addresses, re, see::
        The specified tickets are left in their current status, and the commit
        message is added to them as a comment.

    A fairly complicated example of what you can do is with a commit message
    of:

        Changed blah and foo to do this or that. Fixes my-project:#10 and
        #12, and refs my-other-project:#12.

    This will close #10 and #12 in my-project, and add a note to #12 in
    my-other-project.

    Note that project names must not contain any whitespace characters. Project
    name matching is case insensitive.
