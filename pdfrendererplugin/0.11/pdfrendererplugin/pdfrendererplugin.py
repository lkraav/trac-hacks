    ----
    This interface will be merged with IContentConverter, as conversion
    to text/html will be simply a particular type of content conversion.

    However, note that the IHTMLPreviewRenderer will still be supported
    for a while through an adapter, whereas the IContentConverter interface
    itself will be changed.

    So if all you want to do is convert to HTML and don't feel like
    following the API changes, rather you should rather implement this
    interface for the time being.
