Single Project Installation (recommended):

1. change into the directory where setup.py is located
   "cd <path to setup.py>"
2. run "python setup.py bdist_egg"
3. copy the egg file into your projects plugin path
   (unix ) "cp dist/ProjectPlan-<ver>-<pythonver>.egg <path to the project>/plugins/"
   (windows) "copy dist\ProjectPlan-<ver>-<pythonver>.egg <path to the project>\plugins"
4. cleanup build files
  (unix) "rm -rf dist build ProjectPlan.egg-info"
  (windows) "del /F /S /Q dist build ProjectPlan.egg-info"

Trac Installation (for all Projects, not recommended at the moment):

1. change into the directory where setup.py is located
"cd <path to setup.py>"
2. run "python setup.py install" with sufficent rights
3. cleanup build files
  (unix) "rm -rf dist build ProjectPlan.egg-info"
  (windows) "del /F /S /Q dist build ProjectPlan.egg-info"

First Configuration:

1. Setup Ticket-Custom fields
  * If you arleady have Dependency, Assign/Close Date Ticket-Custom Fields
   * you can reuse them with
-- start --
[pp_options]
custom_dependency_field = <your dependency fieldname>
custom_due_assign_field = <your assign Date fieldname>
custom_due_close_field = <your close Date fieldname>
-- end --
    * this lets projectplanplugin use these configured fields
  * If you dont have those Fields, add the following Ticket-Custom fields
-- start --
[ticket-custom]
dependencies = text
dependencies.label = Dependencies
due_assign = text
due_assign.label = Due to assign
due_assign.value = DD/MM/YYYY
due_close = text
due_close.label = Due to close
due_close.value = DD/MM/YYYY
-- end --

2. Basic GraphViz Configuration (needed for Networks):
 * with WebAdmin
   * login with administrative Rights, navigate to Admin (WebAdmin)
   * Select the Panel ProjectPlan -> General Settings (on the left)
   * Verify the Settings for cachepath and dot_executable
 * or set the following options in the projects trac.ini
-- start --
[pp_options]
cachepath = <full path to the cache directory>
dot_executable = <path to graphviz binaries>\dot.exe
-- end --
   * restart your webserver for configuration reload
 * Verify access and execution rights for the webserver User
 ! cachepath should be a separate directory for each project,
   this reduces possible cache collisions

3. Color Setup:
  * login with administrative Rights, navigate to Admin (WebAdmin)
  * Select the Panel ProjectPlan -> Color Settings (on the left)
  * Set HTML Color codes and apply Settings
