Installation:

Step 1: Setup a user on your remote production server so that apache can ssh to the server (yes I know this is a huge security gap but I couldn't get ssh to allow me to specify alternative directories for .ssh so I had to give apache a home directory)

CREATE TABLE file_revision (file text, rev text);
