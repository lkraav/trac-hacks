You will need the `refactoring` branch of pyndexter, available from 
[http://swapoff.org/svn/pyndexter/branches/refactoring/ here]. Home page is
[http://swapoff.org/pyndexter here], though not up to date yet.

You'll also need one of Xapian, Hype, the Hyperestraier SWIG bindings or Lupy
(being the only indexers mostly working) installed.

Modify trac.ini:

{{{
[repo-search]
indexer = hype:///tmp/reposearch-hype.idx
}}}

You can use the `update-index` script to trigger manual indexing.
