To make the sample TicketChanger plugin work, you need to add this to
your trac.ini:

[repository-hooks]
post-commit = TicketChanger

You also need to add a post-commit hook to SVN:
#!/bin/sh


REPOS="$1"
REV="$2"


full_path_to_python full_path_to_repository_hook_system/listener.py --hook=post-commit -p full_path_to_repository $REV
