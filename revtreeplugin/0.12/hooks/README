The python scripts in this directory should be copied into a new 'hooks' 
directory that should be created in your Trac installation directory (not 
the Trac environment directory), for example as in 
/usr/lib/python2.x/site-packages/trac/hooks

These scripts are called from the svn hooks stub scripts (see the README file
in the 'svnstubs' directory).

The Python scripts are currently being reworked. They run successfully on my
servers, but your mileage may vary
