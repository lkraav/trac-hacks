SWFObject Readme

v1.5

SWFObject is a small Javascript file used for embedding Macromedia Flash content. The script can detect the Flash plug-in in all major web browsers (on Mac and PC) and is designed to make embedding Flash movies as easy as possible. It is also very search engine friendly, degrades gracefully, can be used in valid HTML and XHTML 1.0 documents, and is forward compatible, so it should work for years to come.

* SWFObject is the Flash embed script formerly known as FlashObject. The name was changed after a request from Adobe
  for legal / trademark reasons.
