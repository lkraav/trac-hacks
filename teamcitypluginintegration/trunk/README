INSTALLATION:

Get latest version from svn:
  svn co http://trac-hacks.org/svn/teamcitypluginintegration/trunk

Build egg:
  cd teamcity
  python setup.py bdist_egg

Copy egg file to trac plugins dir:
  cp dist/TeamCityPlugin-X.X-pyY.Y.egg /path/to/trac/instance/plugins/

Edit Trac config.ini, enable plugin:
  [components]
  teamcity.* = enabled

Add permissions to users allowed to build and/or configure plugin. There are two trac permissions: TEAMCITY_BUILD (allows to view /trac-instance/builds page and run builds) and TEAMCITY_ADMIN (allows to edit plugin settings). 
  trac-admin /path/to/trac/instance permission add authenticated TEAMCITY_BUILD

Edit plugin settings. All plugin settings are stored in config.ini, so you can add a new section to config.ini or go to trac-instance/admin/teamcity/builds and fill the web-form. Settings: 
  [teamcity]
  base_url = http://<your_ci_server>:<port>  # base url to TC server, WITHOUT trailing slash
  username = trac 
  password = trac                 # TC credentials which plugin will use to access TC server
  cache_dir = /tmp/teamcity_cache # Plugin will cache here build logs from teamcity
  builds = bt1,bt2                # a list of buildTypeId from TC to follow
  limit = 10080                   # Number of minutes for timeline. 
                                  # Plugin will add events to timeline for builds which are newer then now()-limit
