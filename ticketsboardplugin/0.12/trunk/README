About TicketsBoardPlugin
======================

TicketsBoardPlugin is a trac plug-in that adds a virtual whiteboard view of
active tickets.

This virtual whiteboard ('Ticketsboard') is a table divided in ticket states.
Inside these states, each ticket is shown as a sticky note.
You can drag&drop a sticky note to another column to change ticket state.

But, these states are predefined and are as following:
 - New: default state when you create a ticket, used for tickets on which we do
   not work on
 - Assigned: used for tickets on which we work on but not currently
 - In Progress: used for tickets on which we are currently working on
 - Wait review: used to inform developers that the development is ended and
   owners are waiting for a reviewer
 - Reviewing: used for tickets that are being reviewed by reviewers
 - Integrating: used for tickets that are reviewed and ready to be pushed on the
   base
 - Validating: used for tickets that are in base and waiting for agreement of
   the validation team
 - Suspended: used for tickets that are expecting information, works... of
   another team

As the amount of tickets could be significant, the ticketsboard shows only
tickets where the ticket checkbox 'On Ticketsboard' is checked. This checkbox is
created by the plug-in.

To have a quick view of all printed tickets they have different colors
according to there types:
 - red: for defects
 - yellow: for enhancements
 - blue: for tasks


This plug-in is divided in two parts:

1/ Reviewer field
This part adds, in tickets, a new textbox field 'reviewer' that will contain the
name of the reviewer.
This new field could also be managed in the ticket-workflow. So, each change
on ticket state can be combined with a control on the reviewer field
(set_reviewer, del_reviewer).

2/ Virtual whiteboard ('Ticketsboard')
It adds a new tab in the mainnav bar.
This tab shows a dedicated html page that represents the virtual whiteboard.
A user can change tickets states through a drag and drop system. As there are
restrictions on some states (set_owner, set_reviewer...), changes could be rejected.
This part adds the checkbox 'On Ticketsboard' and checks that the ticket-workflow
contains the needed states.
