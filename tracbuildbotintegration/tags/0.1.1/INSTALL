== Installation ==

 The easiest way to install TracBuildbot is to generate an egg file using
python setup.py bdist_egg

 The egg file generated in the dist directory can then be copied in the plugin
directory of your trac project.

== Configuration ==
 The only configuration to be mayed in the trac.ini file is to declare the server
url. The url is the one were root page of the waterfall website of your buildbot
server.

The trac.ini file would look like

[buildbot]
url = http://localhost:8081/

If the buildbot server is on the local machine.

Don't forget to activate the plugin if it isn't by adding

[components]
buildbot.* = enabled
