<form id="show_text">
  <p>Unfortunatelly Admin plug-in cannot serve another format of data than HTML, so text data are shown in textarea. To save them just click inside the textarea and press ctrl+A to select all data contained in it and copy them to clipboard. Then you can paste data into your texteditor and save them.</p>
  <textarea><?cs var:data.text ?></textarea>
