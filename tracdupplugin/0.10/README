Ticket Duplication Plug-in
--------------------------

ABOUT
-----
This plug-in adds the capability of duplicating tickets to other tickets
using three custom fields: dup_of, dups, and dup_count.
Changes in the master ticket are reflected to the slave tickets and vice
versa.

NOTE
----
The 0.11 version works on 0.10 as well, at least up to revision 6520 and
version 0.1.1, so please check in the 0.11 directory instead.
