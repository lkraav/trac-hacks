  <p>Be sure to set the <strong>component</strong> of your ticket to the name of
     the hack you have a grievance with. Most hack pages will have a link
     specifically for creating new tickets against them. Use it.

  <p>If you do not do this it is highly likely that the hack author <strong>will not be
    aware of your ticket and it will be ignored</strong>.</p>
