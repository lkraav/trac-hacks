= TracHtGroupEditor =

A simple editor for Apache htgroup files. It allows to add and remove users
to multiple groups.

It depends on the WebAdminPlugin and is useful in conjunction with the
AccountManagerPlugin and/or HtgroupsPlugin. It can also be used if multiple
Tracs on a server are protected by a htgroup file (one file per Trac or one
global file for all is supported).

== Installation ==
Make sure you have the WebAdmin plugin installed.

 1. Run: {{{python setup.py bdist_egg}}}
 2. If necessary create a folder called "plugins" in your Trac environment.
 3. Copy the .egg file from the dist folder created by step 1 into the "plugins"
    directory of your Trac environment.

or install it site wide with {{{python setup.py install}}}

== Configuration ==
Add one of the following sections to trac.ini to manage an Apache htpasswd or
htdigest file.

=== Htgroup ===
If a specific {{{[htgroup-editor]}}} section exists it will be used to get the
file name.
{{{
[htgroup-editor]
group_file = /path/to/trac.htgroup
}}}

Alternatively, it will also read the {{{group_file}}} option from a
{{{[account-manager]}}} section.
