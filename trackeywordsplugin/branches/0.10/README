Ticket Keywords Plug-in
-----------------------

This plug-in allows you to add keywords to a ticket from a configured list
of keywords.

To use it:
- enable the component in trac's configuration by editing trac.ini and,
  in the [components] section, add

trackeywords.* = enabled

- adapt your templates/ticket.cs template, or copy the default one there and
  adapt it, adding the line:

<?cs include "keywords.cs" ?>

    which will insert a field set.

The recommended place to put this is right after the "Change Properties" field
set.

- configure the list of keywords you want to use by adding
  a [keywords] section in the trac configuration file.  Syntax is:

        keyword = description


Notes
-----
I chose to make it a seperate field set, instead of putting it in the
Change Properties field set, because there it conflicted with the
condfields plugin, which was hiding our Add Keywords line
