= Restrict to some user the access to Trac 

== Description

The goal of TracRestrictAccessPlugin is to restrict the access to Trac to the users with {{{TRAC_RESTRICT_ACCESS}}} permission.

This mean that the restricted users can:
- only view wiki pages under the directory {{{/trac/wiki/SharedPages/}}}
- only view tickets that concern themselves. (ie: they are {{{reporter}}} or {{{owner}}} or {{{cc}}}).



Thanks to the author of PrivateTicketsPlugin where I took the idea to restrict the view of tickets.

== Installation

General instructions on installing Trac plugins can be found on the [TracPlugins#InstallingaTracplugin TracPlugins] page.

You must enabled it ({{{restrictaccess.* = enabled}}}) and also add {{{RestrictAccessPolicy}}} to your {{{permission_policies}}} setting in {{{trac.ini}}}. It must be before the {{{DefaultPermissionPolicy}}}. See below for an example if you don't have any other policies.

Then to limit access to some users simply give them the permission 
{{{TRAC_RESTRICT_ACCESS}}}


== Example

Example of {{{trac.ini}}}:
{{{
[components]
...
restrictaccess.* = enabled
...

[trac]
...
permission_policies = RestrictAccessPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy
}}}
