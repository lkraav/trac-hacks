Notes
=====

The TracTicketChangesetsPlugin hooks into changeset notifications and searches
commit messages for ticket references. Referenced tickets are updated with the
commit message, and all concerning changesets for a ticket are presented in a
separate section on ticket pages, just above the change history section.

The plugin works with multiple repositories.
Language is translated if Babel is installed.

The implementation is mainly based on rev 9629 of
http://svn.edgewall.org/repos/trac/trunk/tracopt/ticket/commit_updater.py


This plugin is not compatible with Trac 0.11 or older versions.


Configuration
=============

To enable the plugin::

  [components]
  ticketchangesets.* = enabled

Add the section [ticket-changesets] to configure the behaviour::

  [ticket-changesets]
  check_perms = true
  collapsed = false
  commands.close = close closed closes fix fixed fixes
  commands.refs = addresses re refs references see ticket tickets
  compact = true
  hide_when_none = false
  notify = false
  resolution = fixed


Installation
============

1. The Trac environment needs to be upgraded::

     trac-admin %ENV% upgrade

2. Re-synchronize repositories (optional, but recommended before next step
   which will scan all existing commit messages)::

       trac-admin %ENV% repository resync "*"

3. Build relations between tickets and changesets::

       trac-admin %ENV% ticket_changesets resync

4. Re-format existing ticket commit messages (DANGEROUS!)

   a. Produce a diff-like output for your analysis, which does not affect the
      database, before re-formatting existing commit messages::

          trac-admin %ENV% ticket_changesets diff > out.diff

      Examine out.diff and assert that re-formatting is sensible before next
      step.

   b. Re-format (DANGEROUS!)::

          trac-admin %ENV% ticket_changesets reformat

5. Setup hook-scripts (Windows example, does not differ from official
   instructions applicable to Trac 0.12)

   a. post-commit.cmd::

          :: Trac 0.12 post-commit hook script for Windows
          ::
          @SET TRAC_ENV=...
          @SET REPOS=%1
          @SET REV=%2
          @trac-admin "%TRAC_ENV%" changeset added "%REPOS%" "%REV%"

   b. post-revprop-change.cmd::

          :: Trac 0.12 post-revprop-change hook script for Windows
          ::
          @SET TRAC_ENV=...
          @SET REPOS=%1
          @SET REV=%2
          @trac-admin "%TRAC_ENV%" changeset modified "%REPOS" "%REV%"

From here-on, tickets will be updated when referenced in a commit message, and
the relation between tickets and revisions are automatically tracked.
