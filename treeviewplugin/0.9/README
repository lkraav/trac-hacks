About
-----

This plugin provides the ability to display a neat rendering of any
hierarchical data structure such as a set of files within a file system,
hosts on a network, or similar.

Syntax
------

The plugin adds the following syntactic elements to the wiki processor:

+-
--

+- is the token to begin a new tree or continue one in progress. Add entries
with 

+-*name

* is some separator character (e.g. / for directories, . for parts of
a domain name, or any other character except for whitespace)
name is some unique identifier within the current tree, possibly containing
further separators and names (nodes).

A tree's entries are ended with --. If -- is seen but the processor is not in
'capture tree nodes' mode, -- will be rendered as-is.


Features
--------

 * Attempts will be made by the plugin to disambiguate nodes following
   deterministic rules, so only the information necessary to uniquely identify a
   parent node need be provided when adding further nodes.

 * Nodes may be designated as 'terminal' or 'container'. Container nodes
   obviously contain further nodes, but otherwise-terminal nodes may be
   marked as containers for display purposes.

 * When a tree is displayed in a wiki page, entire sub-trees may be
   collapsed/ expanded as desired. The whole tree is considered a subtree,
   so the collapse/ expand rule applies just as well to it as to any other.
   (requires javascript)

 * Intermediate nodes are created on demand. There is no need to separately
   specify each and every child node in a long branch.

 * Comments may be added to terminal nodes (or empty container nodes).


Examples
--------

Probably best illustrated with some examples.

  Simple Tree, showing several features.
  --------------------------------------

+-.A.B.C  # Node 'B' is auto-vivified
+-C.D     # 'C' is unique in the prior subtree
+-.A.E    # E will be added as a child of A
+-.F      # F will be added as a new top-level node
--

This will be displayed as something like:

.
+--- A
|    +--- B
|    |    +--- C
|    |         +--- D
|    +--- E
+--- F


  The 'trac' directories
  --------------------

+-/usr/share/trac/
+-/usr/share/trac/templates
+-/usr/share/trac/cgi-bin
+-/usr/share/trac/wiki-default
+-/usr/share/trac/htdocs
+-/usr/share/trac/htdocs/css
+-/usr/share/trac/htdocs/js
+-/usr/share/trac/wiki-macros
--

which is displayed as something like:

[V] usr
    +--- [V] share
             +--- [V] trac
                      +--- templates
                      +--- cgi-bin
                      +--- wiki-default
                      +--- [V] htdocs
                      |        +--- css
                      |        +--- js
                      +--- wiki-macros

Note the 'collapse subtree' buttons, marked as [V].

Limitations
-----------

 * Whitespace cannot be used as a node delimiter.
 * Duplicate children of a parent node are not supported.
 * Cyclical hierarchies are not supported.
