Notes
=====
Creates a set of virtual permissions for tickets that the user is associated with.

There are three main permissions for this plugin: ``TICKET_IS_REPORTER``,
``TICKET_IS_CC``, and ``TICKET_IS_OWNER``. ``TICKET_IS_SELF`` is an
alias for all three of these.

With each permission, users will be granted the permissions where they are
the person mentioned in the permission. So if a user has
``TICKET_IS_REPORTER``, they can only get the permisson for ticket they
reported. For ``TICKET_IS_CC``, they just have to be included in the CC list.

There are also group-based permissions: ``TICKET_IS_REPORTER_GROUP``,
``TICKET_IS_CC_GROUP``, and ``TICKET_IS_OWNER_GROUP``. These work in a
similar way to their non-group counterparts, except that you are granted
the permission if you share a group with the target user. For example, if ticket 1 was
reported by Allan, and Allan and Bob are both in the group company_foo, and
Bob has ``TICKET_IS_REPORTER_GROUP``, then Bob will get the permission for ticket 1
since he shares a group with the reporter. Each group-based permission is also
an alias for the normal one, so you do not have to grant both.
``TICKET_IS_GROUP`` is an alias for all the group-based permissions (and
therefore all the normal ones as well).

Finally, users with ``TRAC_ADMIN`` will automatically get all these permissions.
The meta-user "anonymous" also cannot be restricted by this plugin, as their
identity isn't known to be checked.

Configuration
=============
All configuration options go in the ``[virtualticketpermissions]`` section.

``group_blacklist``
    Groups to ignore for the purposes of the ``*_GROUP`` permissions.
    
    Defaults to "``anonymous, authenticated``"

You must also add ``VirtualTicketPermissionsPolicy`` to your ``permission_policies``
setting in trac.ini. See below for an example if you don't have any other policies.
