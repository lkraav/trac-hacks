{{{
  python setup.py bdist_egg
  cp dist/*.egg /path/to/projenv/plugins
}}}

== Syntax ==
[[WantedPages]] or [[WantedPages(show_referrers)]]

Will yield a list of wanted wiki pages or a list of wanted wiki pages with
a list of pages where the wanted wiki page link was found, respectively.

== Running the Tests ==

To run the tests, you must have trac installed and its python files
must be accessible to python.

To run the tests, run `python tests.py` in the wanted_pages subdirectory of the
root of the WantedPages source distribution. The tests parse this file and then
checks the positive and negative test cases listed below.

== TODO ==

* The macro currently incorrectly identifies the following as a !MyPage link:
  !attachment:wiki:MyPage:the_file.txt creates a link to the attachment the_file.txt of the !MyPage wiki page

== 0.3 Changelog ==
 * Added support to show the referrers for each wanted page

== 0.2 Changelog ==

 * Improved link detection, fixing many bugs not even reported 
 * Fixed [wiki:link] not being picked up
 * No longer need spaces around a wiki link for it to show up
 * Fixed {{{ CodeSegments }}} being picked up
