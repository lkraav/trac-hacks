Notes
=====
A simple macro to include a sequence diagram from www.websequencediagrams.com.

Installation via Source
=======================

The installation of the sequence diagram plugin from source is done by
creating a Python egg distribution file and copying the .egg file to
the Trac plugins directory. Detailed information on Python eggs can be
found at: http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/PythonEggs. In
addition, the Easy Install package is required to create Python
eggs. See http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall for more
information on using and installing Easy Install.

Change to the download directory and run:

    python setup.py bdist_egg

This will generate a python egg in the dist directory. Copy the egg
file into the trac/plugins directory and follow the Configuration
steps outlined below.

Configuration (trac.ini)
========================

To enable the plugin::

  [components]
  sequencediagram.* = enabled
  
Optionally you can specify a style for the sequence diagram by adding 
a sequence diagram section to the trac.ini file:

  [sequencediagram]
  style = rose
