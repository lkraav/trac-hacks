The former single-file plugin got an informal "license", that has been more of
a coder statement rather than a real license in legal sense:

"THE BEER-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 42):
<trac@matt-good.net> wrote this file.  As long as you retain this notice you
can do whatever you want with this stuff.  If we meet some day, and you think
this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.  Matthew Good
(Beer-ware license written by Poul-Henning Kamp
 http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/)

This software now contains voluntary contributions made by many individuals.
Only small chunks of the original code are left, and while former contributors
may not have agreed on the informal statement above by heart, they cannot be
reached with reasonable effort to agree on another license retrospectively.

From the agreement reached with Matthew Good for AccountManagerPlugin I know,
that he's not totally against adding a real license.  Therefore I choose the
modified BSD license - matching Trac core's license - for ongoing development.
