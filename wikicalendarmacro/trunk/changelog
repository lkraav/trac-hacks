wikicalendar-2.0.0 (30-Mar-2013) - new 'bundled macros' edition

   guarantee Unicode encoded, valid XHTML output

 new features
 * macro collection based on WikiTicketCalendar `trunk` branch pulled into

 * calendar header localization according to user preferences, if supported
   by server (Trac >= 0.12, probably fails on Windows OS due to locale issues)
