    Macro that lists tickets that match certain criteria.

    This macro accepts a comma-separated list of keyed parameters,
    in the form "key=value".

    If the key is the name of a field, the value must use the syntax
    of a filter specifier as defined in TracQuery#QueryLanguage.
    Note that this is ''not'' the same as the simplified URL syntax
    used for `query:` links starting with a `?` character.

    In addition to filters, several other named parameters can be used
    to control how the results are presented. All of them are optional.

    Also, using "&" as a field separator still works but is deprecated.
