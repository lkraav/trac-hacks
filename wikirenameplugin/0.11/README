Notes
=====

This plugin allows you to rename wiki pages. It is an evolution of the
WikiRenameScript_, and currently has the same limitations.

It will move a page and its history, and will rewrite explicit links
(``[wiki:PageName Label]``) leading to it from other wiki pages. It
will also move any attachments on the page.

:warn: Currently this plugin doesn't interact well with the TagsPlugin_.
       You should be careful to remove any tags on a page before 
       renaming it, and then re-adding them to the new page.

You can access the page rename form through the Admin system. For
convenience, a link is also added to the context navigation bar in the
wiki.

Script
======

A script named ``trac-wikirename`` will automatically be installed.

To use it::

    trac-wikirenmate OldName NewName /path/to/trac/env

Permissions
===========

A ``WIKI_RENAME`` permission is available, though anyone with 
``WIKI_ADMIN`` will also be allowed to rename pages.

Configuration
=============

To enable the plugin::

    [components]
    wikirename.* = enabled
