Notes
=====

This plugin allows you to search and replace text in wiki pages.

It is based on the wikirename plugin: http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/WikiRenamePlugin.

After renaming a new version of the wiki page is created with a log of the changes.

You can access the page search & replace form through the Admin system. 

Script
======

A script named ``trac-wikireplace`` will automatically be installed.

To use it::

    trac-wikireplace old-text new-text /path/to/trac/env

Permissions
===========

A ``WIKI_REPLACE`` permission is available, though anyone with 
``WIKI_ADMIN`` will also be allowed to replace in pages.

Configuration
=============

To enable the plugin::

    [components]
    wikireplace.* = enabled
