End-of-life note
----------------
0.10 branch of WikiTicketCalendar macro represents the beginning of this 
valuable piece of open source code.

After Trac 0.11 introduced different ExtensionPoints this has been 
adapted and improved a lot. Now there's even a native 0.12 version 
supporting localized text, if Babel is installed at your sytem as well.

#7239 at trac-hacks.org raised serious concerns about adding ticket contents 
unchecked to HTML output, so it MIGHT BE possible to DISCLOSE SENSITIVE 
INFORMATION from the server. A solution is done now to sanitize all user 
edited strings with Genshi. Porting this to the 0.10 branch as well 
would require to replace most of current code and this seems not worth 
the effort anymore.

Please, thoroughly consider upgrading your Trac before creating tickets 
for this old branch, that might be closed as 'wontfix' anyway.
