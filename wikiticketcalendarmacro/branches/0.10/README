End-of-life note
----------------
0.10 branch of WikiTicketCalendar macro represents the beginning of this 
valuable piece of open source code.

After Trac 0.11 introduced different ExtensionPoints this has been 
adapted and imporved a lot. Now there's even a native 0.12 version 
supporting localized text, if Babel is installed at your sytem as well.

Please, seriously consider upgrading your Trac before creating tickets 
for this old branch, that might be closed as 'wontfix' anyway.
