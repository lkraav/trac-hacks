`This document is for Linux and Unix users only.`

zhTrac has two installation mode:
    * As a patch: for users who have installed English version trac.
    * New install.


== Prepare to install ==
First, check out zhTrac from repository:
{{{
    $ svn co http://svn.rdev.kingsoft.net/kdoc/tangle/kspigrp/kspi.tasks/TracChineseTranslation/0.10/install Trac0.10.4_zh
}}}

=== check if trac installed ===
{{{
    $ python -c 'import trac'
If no exception, it means trac is installed.
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named  trac
}}}


== GNU/Linux install guide ==

=== Patch zhTrac to Trac0.10.4  ===
{{{
$ cd /path/to/u/Trac0.10.4_zh
$ sudo ./setup.py cn /path/to/environment
}}}
 * /path/to/environment is trac environment path

 Note::
 * All default wiki pages will be patched and will install Chinese wiki pages.
 * If default wiki pages have been modified, zhTrac can't ensure patch is safe!

==== Back to English version ====
{{{
$ sudo ./setup.py en /path/to/environment
}}}
 * /path/to/environment is trac environment path.

=== New install ===
If you are sure that no trac is installed after check(describes as above), you can install zhTrac as following:
{{{
$ cd /path/to/u/Trac0.10.4_zh
$ sudo ./setup.py install
}}}     

If trac is installed this way, you can not revert zhTrac to English version. Or you will have to remove zhTrac and reinstall English version trac.

==== Upgrade Trac0.10.4zhX to higher version ====

{{{
$ cd /path/to/u/Trac0.10.4_zhX (path to high version trac)
$ sudo ./setup.py upgrade /path/to/environment
}}}
