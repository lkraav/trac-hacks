Trac源代码浏览器可用来浏览存储在版本控制系统的仓库中的目录和文件及其修订日志.

目录的条目都显示在一个列表中, 该列表中的列都可以进行排序. 单击列标题, 列表的项目可按照''名字'', ''大小''或''时间''等进行排序. 再次单击某个给定的列标题排序, 可以逆转排序的顺序.

The browser can be used to navigate through the directory structure 
by clicking on the directory names. Clicking on a file name will show
the contents of the file. Clicking on the revision number of a file or
directory will take you to the TracRevisionLog for that file.
Note that there's also a ''Revision Log'' navigation link that will do
the same for the path currently being examined.

It's also possible to browse directories or files as they were in history,
at any given repository revision. The default behavior is to display the
latest revision but another revision number can easily be selected using
the ''View revision'' input field at the top of the page.

''(since 0.11)'':

At the top of the browser page, there's a drop-down menu which you can use 
to select some interesting places in the repository, for example branches or tags. 
This is sometimes referred to as the ''browser quickjump'' facility.
The precise meaning and content of this menu depends on your backend.
For Subversion, this list contains by default a few branches (`trunk` and any sub-folder of the latest `branches` top-level folder) and a few tags (any sub-folder of the latest `tags` top-level folder). This can be [TracIni#svn configured] for more advanced cases.

For the Subversion backend, some additional features are available:
 - support for `svn:needs-lock` property
 - support for `svn:externals` property (which can be [TracIni#svn:externals configured])
