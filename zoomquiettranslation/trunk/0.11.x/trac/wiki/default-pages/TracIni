Trac configuration is done by editing the '''`trac.ini`''' config file, located in `<projectenv>/conf/trac.ini`.  Changes to the configuration are usually reflected immediately, though changes to the `[components]` or `[logging]` sections will require restarting the web server. You may also need to restart the web server after creating a global configuration file when none was previously present.

== Global Configuration ==
In previous versions, the global configuration was by default located in `$prefix/share/trac/conf/trac.ini` or sometimes /etc/trac/trac.ini depending on the distribution. If you're upgrading, you may want to specify that file to inherit from.

Global options will be merged with the environment-specific options, where local options override global options. The options file is specified as follows:
{{{
[inherit]
file = /usr/share/trac/conf/trac.ini
}}}

== 参考 ==

This is a brief reference of available configuration options.

== [components] == #components-section
该节是用于启用或禁用插件提供的组件以及Trac本身的组件. 启用或禁用的组件是通过选项的名字来指定的. 能否启用是由选项值决定的, 将值设定为''enabled''或''on''会启用该组件, 其他任意值则禁用该组件, 一般是''disabled''或''off''.

选项名可以是组件的全名, 或模块/安装包的前缀. 前者启用或禁用一个具体的组件, 但后者却可以启用或禁用指定的包或模块中的任意组件.

考虑下列的配置片断:
{{{
[components]
trac.ticket.report.ReportModule = disabled
webadmin.* = enabled
}}}

第一个选项让Trac禁用[wiki:ZhTracReports 报表模块]. 第二个选项让Trac启用`webadmin`包中的所有组件. 注意, 要匹配模块/包, 结尾的通配符是必不可少的.

参见''关于Trac''的''插件''页以获得所有可用组件的列表(要求`CONFIG_VIEW` [wiki:ZhTracPermissions 权限]).

== [ticket-custom] == #ticket-custom-section

In this section, you can define additional fields for tickets. See TracTicketsCustomFields for more details.

== [ticket-workflow] == #ticket-workflow-section
''(since 0.11)''

The workflow for tickets is controlled by plugins. 
By default, there's only a `ConfigurableTicketWorkflow` component in charge. 
That component allows the workflow to be configured via this section in the trac.ini file.
See TracWorkflow for more details.

== [milestone-groups] == #milestone-groups-section
''(since 0.11)''

As the workflow for tickets is now configurable, there can be many ticket states,
and simply displaying closed tickets vs. all the others is maybe not appropriate 
in all cases. This section enables one to easily create ''groups'' of states 
that will be shown in different colors in the milestone progress bar.

Example configuration (which is also the default):
{{{
closed = closed
closed.order = 0                     # sequence number in the progress bar
closed.query_args = group=resolution # optional extra param for the query
closed.overall_completion = true     # count for overall completion

active = *                           # one catch-all group is allowed
active.order = 1
active.css_class = open              # CSS class for this interval
}}}

The definition consists in a comma-separated list of accepted status.
Also, '*' means any status and could be used to associate all remaining
states to one catch-all group.

The CSS class can be one of: new (yellow), open (no color) or
closed (green). New styles can easily be added using the following
selector:  `table.progress td.<class>`

== [svn:externals] == #svn:externals-section
''(since 0.11)''

The TracBrowser for Subversion can interpret the `svn:externals` property of folders out of the box.
However, if those externals are ''not'' using the `http:` protocol, or if a link to a different repository browser (such another Trac or [http://www.viewvc.org/ ViewVC]) is desired, then Trac needs to be able to map an external prefix to this other URL.

This mapping is done in the `[svn:externals]` section of the TracIni

Example:
{{{
[svn:externals]
http://theirserver.org/svn/eng-soft       http://ourserver/viewvc/svn/$path/?pathrev=25914
svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository  http://ourserver/trac/support/browser/$path?rev=$rev
}}}
With the above, the `svn://anotherserver.com/tools_repository/tags/1.1/tools` external will be mapped to `http://ourserver/trac/support/browser/tags/1.1/tools?rev=` (and `rev` will be set to the appropriate revision number if the external additionally specifies a revision, see the [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.externals.html SVN Book on externals] for more details).
